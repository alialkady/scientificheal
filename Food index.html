       <strong><p>To develop your immune system to help you against covid-19 you should Stick to this list:</p></strong>
       <br>
       <ul>
         <li>Good nutrition is essential for a strong immune system, which may provide protection from seasonal illnesses and other health problems. No food or supplement can prevent disease but you can help support your immune system by including these nutrients in your comprehensive eating plan on a regular basis.</li>
         <li>Protein plays a role in the body's immune system, especially in healing and recovery. Eat a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, beans and peas, soy products, and unsalted nuts and seeds.</li>
         <li>Vitamin A helps regulate the immune system and protect against infections by maintaining healthy skin and tissues in the mouth, stomach, intestines and respiratory system. Get this vitamin from foods such as sweet potatoes, carrots, broccoli, spinach, red peppers, apricots, eggs, or foods labeled "fortified" such as milk or some grains.</li>
         <li>Vitamin C supports the immune system by stimulating antibody formation. Include more sources of this healthy vitamin by choosing citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, paprika, papaya, strawberries, tomato juice, or foods fortified with vitamin C, such as some grains.</li>
         <li>Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and may support immune function. Include vitamin E in your diet with fortified cereals, sunflower seeds, almonds, vegetable oils (such as sunflower or safflower oil), hazelnuts, and peanut butter.</li>
         <li>Zinc helps the immune system function properly and may aid wound healing. Zinc can be found in lean meat, poultry, seafood, milk, whole grain products, beans, seeds, and nuts.</li>
         <li>Other nutrients, including vitamin B6, B12, copper, folic acid, selenium, and iron may also support the immune response and play a role in a healthy eating pattern.</li>
         <li>These nutrients are best obtained from foods, so be sure to speak with your healthcare provider or registered dietitian before taking any supplements.</li>

      <strong><p>To heal your immune system to destroy the virus you should Stick to this list:</p></strong>
       <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Proper nutrition and hydration are vital. People who eat a balanced diet tend to be healthier with stronger immune systems and reduced risks of chronic and infectious diseases, so you should eat a variety of fresh and unprocessed foods every day to get the vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, protein, and antioxidants your body needs. Drink enough water. Avoid sugar, fat and salt to significantly reduce the risk of weight gain, obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.</li>
        <li>Eat fresh, unprocessed foods every day</li>
        <li>Eat fruits, vegetables, legumes (such as lentils and beans), nuts, whole grains (such as unprocessed corn, millet, oats, wheat, brown rice, or starchy tubers or roots such as potatoes, yams, taro, or cassava), and foods from animal sources (such as meat, fish, eggs, and milk).</li>
        <li>Daily intake: 2 cups of fruit (4 portions), 2.5 cups of vegetables (5 portions), 180 grams of grains, 160 grams of meat and beans (red meat can be eaten half once a week, poultry 2âˆ’3 times a week ).</li>
        <li>Drink enough water (8-10 glasses of water every day). Water is essential for life. It transports nutrients and compounds in the blood, regulates body temperature, eliminates waste products, lubricates and coats joints.</li>
        <li>Water is the best option, but you can also have other drinks and fruits and vegetables that contain water, such as lemon juice (diluted with water and unsweetened), tea and coffee. But be careful not to get too much caffeine, and avoid sweetened fruit juices, syrups, fruit juice concentrates, and sodas that still contain sugar.</li>
        <li>Eat moderate amounts of fats and oil.</li>
        <li>Consume unsaturated fats (for example found in fish, avocados, nuts, olive oil, soybeans, canola, sunflower, and corn oil) rather than saturated fats (for example found in fatty meats, butter, coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee, and lard).</li>
        <li>Choose white meat (like poultry) and fish, which are generally low in fat, rather than red meat.</li>
        <li>Avoid processed meats, as they are high in fat and salt.</li>
        <li>If possible, choose low-fat or low-fat milks</li>
        <li>Avoid industrially produced trans fats. It is often found in processed foods, fast food, snacks, fried foods, frozen pizza, pies, biscuits, margarine, and spreads.</li>
        <li>Reduce your salt and sugar intake.</li>
        <li>When cooking and preparing food, limit the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (such as soy sauce and fish sauce).</li>
        <li>Limit your intake of sodas or sodas and other drinks with a high sugar content (such as fruit juices, fruit juice and syrup concentrates, flavored milk and yogurt drinks).</li>
        <li>Avoid eating out and eat at home to reduce the rate of contact with others and reduce your chance of exposure to COVID-19. We recommend maintaining a distance of at least 1 meter between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. This is not always possible in crowded social settings such as restaurants and cafes. Droplets from infected people may fall on surfaces and people's hands (such as customers and employees), and with so many people coming and going, you cannot tell if your hands are being washed regularly enough, and surfaces are cleaned and disinfected quickly enough.</li>
        <li>Counseling and psychological support</li>
        <li>While proper nutrition and hydration improve health and immunity, they are not magic bullets. Chronically ill people who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection may need support for their mental health and diet to ensure they maintain good health. Seek counseling and psychosocial support from appropriately trained health care professionals as well as community and peer counselors.</li>
