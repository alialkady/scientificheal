      <center><p>Last months, a dangerous virus (Covid-19) swept the world, most of the countries had a lot of patients
  and dead people because of that dangerous virus. Our countries tried to make quarantine in hospitals
  but all of the hospitals filled with patients and there are other patients outside hospitals. They must
  have quarantine in their houses. Most of them doesnâ€™t even know how to have quarantine at home or
  what medicine to take and so on. Our idea in a simple way is to make a website that would include two
  things: protocol to prevent the spreading of Covid-19 and protocol for people who should have
  Quarantine at home because they are sick. The application would include 4 parts: The first part includes the medicine, The second part includes the food system, the third part includes the ways of quarantine at home, the fourth part includes a link to chat with doctors to help doctors follow up on their health (we would make deals with doctors to do that).
